 * which has an unpatched advisory allowing it to read local files / hit
 * arbitrary URLs even with `disableFileAccess`/`disableUrlAccess` set
 * (https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p6gq-j5cr-w38f). Those two flags are
 * still set below as defense-in-depth against the (non-`raw`) attachment
 * path/URL vectors, which they do cover.
